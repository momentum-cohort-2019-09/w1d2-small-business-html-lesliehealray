                <h2>Wilde Hyacinth</h2>
                <p>
                    This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens.
                    The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus.
                    It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops
                    as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally it is found
                    growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in
                    autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in
                    the autumn. Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by
                    runners.

                <h2>Lily-of-the-Valley</h2>

                <p>
                    With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that
                    dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof
                    shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the
                    pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly,
                    and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial
                    to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well.
                    <strong> Warning: this plant is poisonous.</strong>

                <h2>Crown imperials</h2>

                <p>
                    Crown imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants,
                    making rapid growth in the spring, flowering during
                    April/early May and dying down in early summer. Best
                    in raised beds or planters. Does not tolerate shade;
                    needs a warm, sunny position where it can be left undisturbed
                    for many years.

                <h2>Persian buttercup</h2>

                <p>
                    This species of buttercup can get up to 2 feet tall and has
                    large showy blooms in a variety of colors from May to June.
                    Persian buttercups are most commonly grown from tubers planted
                    in the beginning of spring. Each plant will produce up to 70 blooms
                    in a season. Good for cooler weather; can tolerate light frost.

                <h2>Spring starflower</h2>

                <p>
                    These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and Uruguay and form dense clumps of
                    perennial flowers to chase the winter doldrums away. These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs.
                    They can get up to half a foot tall with a similar spread. Each bulb will produce numerous flowering
                    stems with slender, deeply green foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white
                    petals.

                <h2>Tulips</h2>

                <p>
                    We have a wide variety of tulips in many colors. Plant tulip bulbs in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks before
                    a hard frost is expected and when soils are below 60 degrees F.
